# Coding Project

Here is one of the first programs I learned to write using python:

    x_initial = float(input("Enter the object's initial position: "))
    v_initial = float(input("Enter the object's initial velocity: "))
    a = float(input("Enter the object's acceleration: "))
    t = float(input("Enter the time it takes the object to change position: "))

    x_final = x_initial+v_initial*t+0.5*a*t**2

    print("\nThe final position of the object is ",x_final," meters.")
